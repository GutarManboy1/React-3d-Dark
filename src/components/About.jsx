        Hi, as a software developer with several years of experience, I have
        been focusing on honing my skills in React and JavaScript to build
        dynamic, user-friendly applications. My journey has involved both
        studying and applying these technologies in real-world projects,
        enabling me to deepen my understanding of modern web development
        practices. I have a strong passion for creating clean (hopefully),
        efficient, and maintainable code while delivering intuitive user
        experiences.
        <br />
        Alongside my work in React and JavaScript, I have developed a growing
        interest in Python and Typescript which I am actively exploring to
        expand my skill set and versatility as a developer. My goal is to
        continuously improve as a software engineer, embrace new challenges and
        technologies to deliver innovative solutions and contribute meaningfully
        to any development team. SO HIRE ME!

        ))}
      </div>
    </>
